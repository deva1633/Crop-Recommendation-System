# Crop-Recommendation-System
This project builds a **Crop Recommendation System** using **machine learning**, trained on the **Crop Recommendation Dataset** from Kaggle.   It predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on **soil composition (N, P, K)** and **environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall)**.
